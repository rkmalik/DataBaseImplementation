=========
Test driver for Assignment 1 heap DBFile (spring 2015 dbi)

This test driver gives a menu-based interface to three options that allows you to test your code:
	1. load (read a tpch file and write it out a heap DBFile)
	2. scan (read records from an existing heap DBFile)
	3. scan & filter (read records and filter using a CNF predicate)

Note that the driver only works with the tpch files (generated using the dbgen program).

To compile the driver, type
	make test.out

To run the driver, type
	test.out
and follow the on-screen instructions.
